/**
 * DOC: Interrupt management for the V3D engine
 *
 * When we take a binning flush done interrupt, we need to submit the
 * next frame for binning and move the finished frame to the render
 * thread.
 *
 * When we take a render frame interrupt, we need to wake the
 * processes waiting for some frame to be done, and get the next frame
 * submitted ASAP (so the hardware doesn't sit idle when there's work
 * to do).
 *
 * When we take the binner out of memory interrupt, we need to
 * allocate some new memory and pass it to the binner so that the
 * current job can make progress.
